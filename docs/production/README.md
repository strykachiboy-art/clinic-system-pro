# Clinic System Pro v5 — Production Evidence Pack

This directory contains the Phase 5 production-readiness evidence
and the executed Phase 6 production-like backend environment evidence.

Phase 5 establishes the production-readiness contract. Phase 6 establishes
and verifies the production-like backend environment used for operational
validation.

It does not claim that production deployment has occurred.

## Phase 6 Executed Evidence

The following Phase 6 evidence artifacts are retained:

- `artifacts/production-readiness/phase6/migration-bootstrap-be32576.txt`
- `artifacts/production-readiness/phase6/socketio-image-promotion-5957367.txt`

## Current Verified Backend State

- Git revision: `5957367208670df64cc2116eb0dd48620021e9c0`
- migration head: `4d205e66d288`
- migration heads: single head
- migration bootstrap: zero-to-head passed
- public tables: 75
- legacy `messages` table: absent
- Redis connectivity: verified
- Celery worker connectivity: verified
- Socket.IO registration under `/chat`: verified
- HTTPS reverse proxy and TLS: verified
- graceful backend restart: verified
- graceful worker restart: verified
- graceful Beat restart: verified
- Celery shutdown under 10,000-task backlog: verified
- backup creation and checksum verification: verified
- isolated database restore: verified
- isolated filesystem restore: verified
- post-restore verification: verified
- live-state isolation throughout disposable drills: verified
- immutable Phase 6 image:
  `ghcr.io/strykachiboy-art/clinic-system-pro@sha256:0fb49c80b1038635256b9b583a1149ae847ebc8a79cfd8d88b24ec81bf183c3e`

The production-like Phase 6 environment evidence is time-specific and does
not by itself establish production deployment readiness.

## Environment-Dependent Validation

The following remain dependent on later release gates or actual production
execution:

- rollback execution using two approved identifiable release states
- image signing and release-signature verification
- measured production resource and cost baseline
- independent external security testing
- actual production deployment
- post-deployment smoke testing and verification

These must not be represented as completed until independently executed
and evidenced.

## Open Evidence Gates

The following remain tracked before final release-candidate freeze:

- crash-safe Celery redelivery validation
- notification/provider idempotency under crash recovery
- rollback execution using two approved identifiable release states
- fully hash-pinned dependency artifact reproducibility
- image signing and release-signature verification
- review and disposition of open dependency-update pull requests
- final release-candidate freeze
- actual production deployment and post-deployment validation

As of the current repository state, open dependency-update pull requests
include #3 (Pillow) and #5 (qrcode).

These gates must not be represented as completed until independently
executed and evidenced.

## Final Regression

The latest full application regression completed with:

- 7,397 passed
- 0 failed
- 0 errors
- 2 skipped

The run completed on 2026-10-01 in 8,078.52 seconds (2:14:38) and is
treated as time-specific evidence.
